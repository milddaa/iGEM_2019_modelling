# iGEM_2019_modelling

This repository contains scripts written for iGEM 2019 dry lab project, in which we aim to use computer modelling to characterize P2 genetic switch system.

The first deterministic and stochastic models of P2 switch, as well as plasmids A, B and AB can be found in the folder Python. The updated models written in MATLAB code are under MATLAB folder.
